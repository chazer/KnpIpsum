    <h1>Concatenate and filter your javascripts with Assetic</h1>
    
    <p>Here we are using Google Closure API to minify your two javascripts
        (assetic-demo-0.js and assetic-demo-1.js).</p>
    
    <p>In production, it would also compile the two files in one single file.</p>
    
    <p>You could also use YuiCSS to do the same thing with CSS, or even 
        <a href="http://lesscss.org/">less</a> or <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>
        as a dynamic stylesheet language which would be converted to css by 
        assetic filters.</p>
    
    {% javascripts
        'bundles/knpipsum/js/assetic-demo-0.js'
        'bundles/knpipsum/js/assetic-demo-1.js'
        filter='closure'
    %}
        <script src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
    {% endjavascripts %}

    <p>Nice, isn't it?</p>
